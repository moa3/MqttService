This is my First attempt at a usefull Android app.

It's derived from Dirk Moor''s MqttService.

The initial idea and goal is to have an easily configurable notification system 
on and Android phone using any mqtt broker

MqttService for Android

Roughly based on Dale Lane's blog article:
http://dalelane.co.uk/blog/?p=1599

Cleaned up code and made more generic. Abstracted Mqtt client library implementation. Bundled Mqtt Client library is Eclipse Paho Mqtt Client.
